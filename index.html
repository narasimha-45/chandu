            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition.

                It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and
                cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and
                industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.

                A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include:

                Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro
                or cassava).
                Legumes (lentils and beans).
                Fruit and vegetables.
                Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).
